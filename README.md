##Remote Control, Monitoring and Data collection System for Agricultural lands
The remote monitoring and controlling system is implemented using wireless internet connection. The sensors interfaced with the ESP32 are used to monitor the agricultural land continuously and data is sent to the remote device using wireless internet connection. A soil-moisture and water pump sensors are controlled remotely with the help of a telegram bot to ensure required temperature and soil moisture respectively. This data is uploaded to an AWS Dynamo database with the help of MQTT protocol. This system may be used to provide required environmental variables for cultivation of the non-seasonal crops. The provision of a suitable environment will also improve crop production.
